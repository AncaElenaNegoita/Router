# Router
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    This project involves implementing a process for directing packets through a router,
specifically by using a router's dataplane. The following elements have been implemented:
- ARP protocol
- Directing process
- Longest Prefix Match (LPM) efficiency using Binary Search
- ICMP protocol

    The main idea behind this implementation involves reading the routing table of the
router and initializing the cache for MACs (arp_table). When the router receives a packet,
it first extracts the Ethernet header and checks if:
- The packet's destination MAC is the MAC of the router (from the interface on which the
packet was received).
- The packet was received following a broadcast (destination MAC address is
FF:FF:FF:FF:FF / 255:255:255:255:255).
If the packet doesn't fit either of these options, it's thrown away.
    Next, the type of the ethernet header is checked. It can be either IPv4
(ether_type = 0x0800 / ETHERTYPE_IP) or ARP (ether_type = 0x0806 / ETHERTYPE_ARP).
If it's any other type, the packet is thrown away.

If the packet is an IPv4 one:
- The IP address of the recipient is checked to see if it the same as the address of
the router (verify if it is for us). If the router is the recipient(ICMP Echo Request),
an ICMP Echo Reply is sent and the destination and source addresses are swapped.
- If the router is not the recipient, it means that the packet needs to be sent further.
The checksum is checked against the one received through the header. If it's not good,
the packet is thrown away. If the TTL of the packet is below 2, an ICMP error message
(Time Exceeded) is sent and a new packet is formed using the new headers, the ICMP headers
and the previous IP header followed by 8 bytes of data from the old packet.
If the packet passes these two checks, the TTL is decremented, and the checksum is
recalculated for the new TTL.
- The best route is then searched for in the routing table so that the packet can be
routed. If there is no route, an ICMP error message (Destination unreachable) is sent.
If there is a route, the MAC is searched in the ARP table of the router, using the next
hop for the packet found in the route table. If the MAC is found, the packet is sent
normally. If the MAC is not found, it's pushed in a "waiting queue" until the router
finds the MAC address of the next point using the ARP request.

If the packet is an ARP:
- If the packet type is ARP Request (operation code = 1), and the router is the recipient
(tpa in the ICMP header is the IP address of the router), a response must be sent
(an ARP Replay).
- If the received packet type is ARP Reply (operation code = 2), then the
router has finally received a response for the request it made. The MAC address that needs
to be searched for is extracted from the received response's ARP header. The received
IP-MAC pair is then put in the ARP table. Each packet from the queue is now verified if
the destination is now found in the table and the packets that respect this condition are
sent away. If not, they are put back in the queue.
- If the router isn't the recipient, then the packet goes in the same steps as in IPv4:
it searches for a route table entry and then in the ARP table. If a match is found, the
message is sent away, else, it's dropped.
